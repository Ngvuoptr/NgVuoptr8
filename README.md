### 3. Tailored to Markdown/README Best Practices

- **Bilingual support**: Offering both Vietnamese and English makes your project accessible to a wider audience.
- **Project overview and features**: These help users quickly understand the purpose and scope of the project.
- **Setup instructions**: Even a basic clone instruction is helpful.
- **Contribution and license sections**: These are standard for open-source projects on GitHub.

If you add these sections, your README will be more informative, accessible, and inviting for contributors!# NgVuoptr8
